I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics, working with Ani Hsieh. Thales received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Minas Gerais, under the supervision of Dr. Luciano Pimenta and Dr. Fernando Souza.

His current research interests include time-delay systems, coordination of multi-agent systems subject to dynamical restrictions, and stability analysis of nonlinear systems.

Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
