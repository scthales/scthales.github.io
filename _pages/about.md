I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics, working with Ani Hsieh. Thales received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Minas Gerais, under the supervision of Dr. Luciano Pimenta and Dr. Fernando Souza.

My current research interests include time-delay systems, coordination of multi-agent systems subject to dynamical restrictions, and stability analysis of nonlinear systems.
