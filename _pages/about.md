I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics,
working with Dr. Ani Hsieh. I received my M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from
the Federal University of Minas Gerais, under the supervision of Dr. Luciano Pimenta and
Dr. Fernando Souza.

My current research interests include time-delay systems, coordination of multi-robot systems
subject to dynamical restrictions, and stability analysis of nonlinear systems.
I am also interested in the efficient representation of high dimensional systems to
design effective control strategies.
